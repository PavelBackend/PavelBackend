## ðŸš€ About My Projects

One of my projects is **HomeSwap** â€” a platform that allows users to exchange their homes for a temporary period, such as vacations or business trips. I'm using technologies like Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, and Docker to build this platform and create a seamless, user-friendly experience for people around the world.

You can check out more about **HomeSwap** in my repository!
